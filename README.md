# TextQuiz
CLI Quiz coded from scratch. Not the best but was a useful exercise when I started.
The real challenge is i'm now rewriting it to use classes. This will be a new introduction for me into object-oriented python - I'm much more comfortable with linear, maths-style operations.

**Features**
- Differentiates between true/false, questions with 4 choices, questions with 2 choices, and questions that have 2 answers.

**Todo**
- Now I'd like to add more customisation. Say a custom title screen.
- Possibly turn this into a quiz generator.
  - Custom start and end titles, custom positive and negative messages, custom questions, custom answers.
  - Output is a fuly functioning quiz. Make it fully contained within a single .py? use py2exe?
- Once CLI is totally finished, attempt to make a GUI version.
